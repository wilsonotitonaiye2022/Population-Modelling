# Population-Modelling

The population modelling app allows you to simulate the population dynamics of a given population over a specified period of time. 

The app allows you to specify the initial population size for each age group and health condition, as well as the transition probabilities between health conditions.
             
The app also allows you to specify the net migration rates between age groups. 
             
The app will then simulate the population dynamics over the specified period of time and provide you with the results in the form of tables and plots.
